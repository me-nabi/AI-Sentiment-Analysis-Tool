# AI-Sentiment-Analysis-Tool
 I developed an AI-powered sentiment analysis tool designed to analyze articles and text. The tool utilizes libraries such as TextBlob and NLTK to summarize the content before providing an overall sentiment grade. ðŸ“‘

By applying natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms, I implemented real-time sentiment evaluation and summary generation. This project offered me valuable experience in AI and NLP, deepening my technical expertise while enhancing my problem-solving skills. ðŸ’¡ It was a rewarding experience to build a tool that simplifies text interpretation through both summaries and sentiment insights. ðŸŽ¯
